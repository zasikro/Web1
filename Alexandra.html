            <p>Cherry blossoms are delicate pink or white flowers that bloom in spring, symbolizing beauty, renewal, and the fleeting nature of life. They are most famously associated with Japan, where they are celebrated during the Hanami festival. Their brief but stunning bloom creates breathtaking landscapes, attracting visitors worldwide. Cherry blossoms belong to the Rosaceae family, which is the rose family. Within this family, they are part of the Prunus genus, which includes cherries, plums, peaches, apricots, and almonds. The most famous cherry blossom species is Prunus serrulata, commonly known as the Japanese cherry or sakura.Other members of the Rosaceae family share similar characteristics, such as five-petaled flowers, often with a pleasant fragrance and a close relationship with fruit-bearing trees.

        <div id="div13"><p class="bold-text2">HISTORY OF CHERRY BLOSSOMS</p>
        <p>Before the prehistoric era, cherry blossoms traveled throughout Japan after migrating there some thousands of years ago.  Because of decades of hybridization, there are currently over 300 different types of sakura, or cherry blossom, trees in Japan.
         According to early accounts, sakura celebrations gained popularity during the Heian Period (794–1185), when emperors and Imperial Palace officials started holding feasts beneath the tree's blossoming branches.  Through the samurai, the festivities spread to the general populace, and the parties gained widespread popularity throughout all societal classes in Japan.  The country's traditions have remained essentially unaltered over the centuries, and the tree is still revered as a significant cultural icon. It cannot be overstated that in Japan, the sakura is serious business -- even government business. Each year, the blossom forecast is analyzed, predicted and released to the public by the Japan Meteorological Agency.
